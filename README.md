# NCAA Basketball Tournament Bracket Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the outcomes of the NCAA Men's and Women's basketball tournaments using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a portfolio of bracket predictions that maximize the Average Bracket Score as per the evaluation criteria provided.

## Project Overview

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Gather historical NCAA basketball tournament data, including team performance, game outcomes, and tournament structures.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the collected data.
   - Prepare features such as team performance metrics, seedings, and tournament paths for modeling.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Build machine learning models to predict game outcomes and tournament brackets.
   - Experiment with different algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks.
   - Utilize ensemble techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

4. **Bracket Generation**:
   - Generate a portfolio of bracket predictions for both the Men's and Women's tournaments.
   - Ensure adherence to the tournament structure and validation of predicted paths.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of bracket predictions using the Average Bracket Score metric.
   - Optimize models and parameters to improve prediction accuracy.

6. **Submission**:
   - Submit the bracket predictions to the designated platform, ensuring compliance with submission guidelines.
